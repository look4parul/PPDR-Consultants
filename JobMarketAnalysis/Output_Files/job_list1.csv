Part-time experience will be credited on the basis of time actually spent in appropriate activities. Applicants wishing to receive credit for such experience must indicate clearly the nature of their duties and responsibilities in each position and the number of hours a week spent in such employment. Physical Requirements: Heavy physical effort is used by the operators in constantly reaching, bending, turning, and moving hands, arms, feet, and legs to handle different sets of controls to operate the equipment and attachments. Considerable strain is caused by the constant vibration of the equipment and the jerking and jolting from operating over rough surfaces. They also perform more exacting work such as digging with a backhoe to close tolerances, requiring considerable manipulation of controls. Because of the location of some of the controls and attachments, the operators are frequently required to work in awkward or strained positions. Working Conditions: Work is performed in all types of weather, in vehicles without air conditioning, often in an open driver's seat or platform, on hills, slopes, grades, rolling surfaces, and forests. The operators are exposed to injury due to the possibility of the equipment overturning. They are subject to noise, vibration, dust, dirt, and fumes from the motor and exhaust. In addition to risks posed by nearby markers and grave sites, the incumbent operates heavy equipment in close proximity to obstacles and hazards such as underground gas and electric lines, water and sewer lines, drains, curbs and trees. Selected applicants will be required to complete an online onboarding process."
